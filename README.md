## Timestamp Microservice
<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to [this](https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com) and deploy it to Glitch.<br>
Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit [this](https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects).<br>
<br>
Here are the specific <b><i>user stories</i></b> you should implement for this project:
<br>
- I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).<br>
- If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.<br>
- If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.<br>
